Design use case diagrams
• Draft initial use case diagrams, then refine to final versions.
• Deadline: March 6, 2025
Design class structure diagrams

(tictactoeBoard.java, tictactoeGame.java, etc.).
• Deadline: March 6, 2025
Create use case descriptions document
• Identify and provide details of different game scenarios (e.g., player move, win condition,
tie detection, reset game).
• Deadline: March 6, 2025
Review and submit documents for iteration 1
• Team review, spell-checking, formatting, proofreading, and final submission to D2L
Dropbox.
• Deadline: March 6, 2025
Milestones:
• team 2 : : iteration 1 Submission: March 7, 2025 (can be seen on Csgit under milestones
tab)


Risk Assessment & Mitigation Planning:
Types of issues that can be encountered:
• Integration Issues: Different components of the OMG platform may not work together
e.g. networking or matchmaking
o Solution: Conduct early integration testing and use stubs to simulate API
interactions.
• Networking failures: Multiplayer connection issues
o Solution: Implementing extensive unit testing for robust error handling and
reconnection fail safes in place.
• Time constraints: Team members fail to deliver on schedule
o Solution: Weekly scrum sessions to track progress and task realignment if
necessary
• Game logic bugs: Unexpected errors or edge cases
o Solution: implementing unit tests and code reviewing.


Development and Implementation

Objective:
Develop and implement a Tic-Tac-Toe game with multiplayer support, AI opponent, and game
state tracking.
