Project Timeline: Networking System

The timeline will cover the planning, development, and implementation of the NETWORKING branch.
Each team member is expected to contribute 3 x 45 minutes per week.


Objective: Implement a matchmaking system for pairing players, tracking scores, win/loss statistics, and ranking systems.


Planning and Design

    - Create planning documents for NETWORKING branch
        - Outline tasks, assign responsibilities, and set rough completion dates.
        - DEADLINE: March 6, 2025

   - Design use case diagrams
        - Create a draft, review, and finalize use case diagrams for matchmaking.
        - DEADLINE: March 6, 2025

  - Design class structure diagrams
        - Create a general class structure diagram for matchmaking-related classes.
        - DEADLINE: March 6, 2025

 - Create use case descriptions document
        - Identify and detail use cases for networking (e.g., client control, game session sync, etc.)
        - DEADLINE: March 6, 2025

- Review and submit documents for Iteration 1
        - Team review, proofread, and submit to D2L dropbox.
        - DEADLINE: March 6, 2025


Milestones

    - Iteration 1 Submission: March 7, 2025


Development and Implementation

    - Objective: Develop and implement a Networking System to receive client requests to join game sessions, server verification of credentials as well as syncing servers to pair players within a game session. 

    - Duration: March 8, 2025 - April 11, 2025 (Post-Iteration 1 to Iteration 3 deadline)

    - Key Features:
        - Server rejects an invalid move and notifies client of an error
        - Server detects disconnections and waits for player to reconnect
        - Player is placed in a matching queue until an opponent is available

**Move sent from the client to the server → server validates the move and updates game session state → updated game state is sent to both players.**


Phase 1: Setup

    - Duration: March 8, 2025 - March 12, 2025

    - Goal: Establish rough skeleton code and finalize design for NETWORKING

    - Task List:
        - Git Repository Setup:
            - Set up Git repository for NETWORKING branch.
            - Start Date: March 4, 2025
            - End Date: March 4, 2025
            - Estimated Time: 1 hour.

        - Finalize class structure design:
            - Adjust class diagram based on feedback.
            - Start Date: March 4, 2025
            - End Date: March 5, 2025
            - Estimated Time: 3 hours.

       - Stub networking logic:
            - Simulate client and server performance within a game session.
            - Start Date: March 10,2025
            - End Date: March 11, 2025
            - Estimated Time: 3 hours.

      - Plan GUI integration:
            - Create a sketch for the networking interface.
            - Start Date: March 11, 2025
            - End Date: March 12, 2025
            - Estimated Time: 3 hours.

Milestone: Setup complete by March 12, 2025.
